          <p>[Placeholder Text] Pam and Connie created BunBun Bakery in 1995, out of their passions for food, friendship and hard work.</p>
          <p>Competitive swimmers and triathletes, Pam and Connie passed their grueling workouts by engaging in passionate conversations about starting their own company and baking, which ultimately inspired them to leave their respective careers in fashion and finance. They opened a small bread shop in 1995, which they named BunBun Bakery.</p>
          <p>From the start they baked everything fresh on-site each day and donated the day’s leftovers to charity each night, actions that remain solidly in place almost 25 years later. BunBun Bakery now has eight locations with more to come, plus ecommerce gift boxes, and recently made its debut in grocery stores with the debut of BunBun Frozen Cookies!</p></div>

          <p>[Placeholder Text] Growing up, my mom always made these for her good friends at Christmastime, and you could literally hear the primal groans of pure joy rising from the rooftops of our town. I’ve carried on the tradition through the years and have won friends and influenced people just by delivering these rolls. They really are that good.</p>
          <p>The frosting will settle in and become one with the cinnamon rolls. And you’ll be another step closer to being the most popular person in town…or the jiggliest, depending on whether you choose to deliver the rolls to friends or lock yourself in your pantry and eat them all by yourself.</p>
          <p>Not that I’ve ever done that, mind you. I don’t ever do things like that. I’m a model of self-discipline. And I don’t have time to do such things—I’m too busy doing the Stairmaster.</p></div>
